- Linear Equation

- System of Linear equation

  - A system of linear equations is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables

- Solution

  - Makes each equation a true statement

- Solution set

  - The set of all possible solutions

- Equivalent

  - if two linear systems have same solutions set, two of them are called Equivalent.

- Intersect <=> Parallel

  - 접점이 있다 vs 평행하다.
  - 해가 있다 vs 해가 없다.

- Consistent

  - If it has either one solution or infinitely many solutions.

- Inconsistent

  - If it has no solution.

- Matrix

  - A collection of vectors

  - Array recorded the essential information of a linear system compactly in a rectangular.

- Coefficient matrix

  - Matrix with the coefficient of each variable aligned in columns.

- Augmented matrix

  - matrix consists of the coefficient matrix with an added column containing the constants from the right sides of the equations.

- Basic strategy of solving a linear system
  - To replace one system with an equivalent system that is easier to solve.
- Three basic operations (They do not change the solution of the system)
  - Replace one equation by the sum of itself and a multiple of another equation (Replacement)
  - Interchange two equations (Interchange)
  - Multiply all the terms in an equation by a nonzero constant (Scaling)

- Row equivalent (Reversible)
  - If there is a sequence of elementary row operations that transforms one matrix into the other.
  - The two systems have the same solution set.
- Two fundamental questions about a linear system
  - Is the system consistent? (At least one solution exist? / Consistent?)
  - If a solution exists, is the solution unique?
