# Definition of Words

> **Data Structure**
>
> A data Structure is data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

>**Algorithm**
>
>An algorithm is step by step procedure, which defines a set of instruction to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

>**Machine Learning**
>
>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with E.
>
>Machine learning is an application of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

> **Supervised Learning**
>
> In the context of AI and ML, Supervised learning is a type of system in which both input and desired output data are provided.

> >**Regression analysis**
> >
> >Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
